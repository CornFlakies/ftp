PARAMETERS:
  SETUP:
    # PROVIDE IN **CM** PLEASE
    DIST_PROJCAM: 39 # distance between projector and camera
    DIST_CAM_FS: 80 # distance between camera and the free surface
  FILTERING: # Using a tukey window
    WINDOW_SIZE: 0.5
    WINDOW_TAPER: 0.3
    # WINDOW_SIZE represent a factor which is multiplied 
    # by the carrier peak index (larger window for further distance from the origin.)
    # WINDOW_TAPER is value between 0 and 1, and determines how strongly the window is wrapped by the cosine
    # If the value is 1, it becomes a hann window, if the value is 0, it becomes square.
